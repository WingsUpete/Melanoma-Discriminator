## Data

Data Source: https://challenge2020.isic-archive.com/

The data has been simplified and split into training/validation sets.

See `MelanomaDataSet.py` for more details

The training/validation/test sets are packed using PyTorch’s `Dataset` and can be accessed through `DataLoader`. For each set, the image data and metadata are packed together as a sample. The images will be transformed with such procedure by default:

1.  Resize and crop randomly to 256 x 256 with scaling of $(h=0.8, w=1.0)$
3.  Flip horizontally and vertically, each with a $probability = 0.5$
3.  Transform to tensor
4.  Normalize channel values with $mean=(0.485, 0.456, 0.406)$, $std=(0.229, 0.224, 0.225)$

## Model

[PyTorch’s `EfficientNet`](https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch#about-efficientnet) is used to construct the model network.

The last fully-connected layer is modified so that its number of output features becomes $500$.

A fully connected layer is added to the end to summarize the features to 1 channel.
