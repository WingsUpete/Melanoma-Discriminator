## Data

Data Source: https://challenge2020.isic-archive.com/

The data has been simplified and split into training/validation sets.

See `MelanomaDataSet.py` for more details

The training/validation/test sets are packed using PyTorchâ€™s `Dataset` and can be accessed through `DataLoader`. For each set, the image data and metadata are packed together as a sample. The images will be transformed with such procedure:

1.  Rescale to 256 x 256
2.  Randomly crop to 224 x 224
3.  Transform to tensor
